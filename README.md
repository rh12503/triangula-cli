# Triangula CLI

A CLI app which uses [Triangula](https://github.com/RH12503/Triangula) to generate triangulated images. For a simpler interface consider using [the GUI](https://github.com/RH12503/Triangula-GUI). 

### Explanation of the algorithm
Running the algorithm saves a _.json_ file every specified number of repetitions. This file contains data with the best set of the points from the algorithm. This file can then be rendered to a PNG or SVG. 

### Running
Run the algorithm using the command:
```
triangula run -img <path/to/your/image> -out <path/to/save/file>
```
For almost all cases, only changing the number of points and leaving all other options with their default values will generate an optimal result, but for a list of available options, run:
```
triangula run -help
```

### Rendering

There are 2 image formats which the _.json_ file can be rendered to: SVG and PNG. PNG is currently the only format that supports effects. 

#### SVG
Renders the _.json_ file to a SVG. 

Usage:
```
triangula render -in path/to/json -out path/to/save/svg
```

Options: 
```
triangula render -help
```

#### PNG
Renders a _.json_ file generated by the algorithm to a PNG. There are also multiple effects that can be applied to the output. 

Usage:
```
triangula render -in path/to/json -out path/to/save/svg -img <path/to/your/image>
```

To add an effect, add the flag:
```
-effect [none|gradient|split]
```

Options: 
```
triangula render -i . -o . -img . png -help
```
